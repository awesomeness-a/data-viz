# Data Visualization with Python
This repository contains four mini-projects files on Data visualization with Python.\
All projects are done in _Jupyter notebook_.

## FIFA
This project is about exploring data from the Fifa World Cup over a period of 1930-2014.\
Using Seaborn, I created a series of plots that explore aggregates and distribution across the goals scored in World Cup games.

Python libraries used: _Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn_.

## GDP Life Expectancy
This project is about investigating if there is a strong correlation between the economic output of a country and the life expectancy of its citizens.

Focusing Questions:
* Has life expectancy increased over time in the six nations?
* Has GDP increased over time in the six nations?
* Is there a correlation between GDP and life expectancy of a country?
* What is the average life expactancy in these nations?
* What is the distribution of that life expectancy?

Python libraries used: _Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn_.

## Kiva
This project is about visualizing insights using a dataset from Kaggle that contains information about loans awarded by the non-profit Kiva.\
Using Seaborn, I'm exploring the average loan amount by country using aggregated bar charts, and visualizing the distribution of loan amounts by project type and gender using box plots and violin plots.

Python libraries used: _Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn_.

## Netflix stock
In this project, I create a set of visualizations of Netflix stock data for the year of 2017:
* The distribution of the stock prices for the past year
* Netflix's earnings and revenue in the last four quarters
* The actual vs. estimated earnings per share for the four quarters in 2017
* A comparison of the Netflix Stock price vs the Dow Jones Industrial Average price in 2017.

Python libraries used: _Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn_.
